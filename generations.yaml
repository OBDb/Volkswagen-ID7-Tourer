    description: "The Volkswagen ID.7 Tourer represents the brand's first electric station wagon, combining the sleek, aerodynamic design of the ID.7 sedan with enhanced cargo capacity and versatility. Built on Volkswagen's dedicated MEB (Modular Electric Drive Matrix) platform, the ID.7 Tourer features an elegant, elongated silhouette with a gently sloping roofline that extends further back than the sedan variant, creating a distinctive yet practical profile with a drag coefficient of approximately 0.24—remarkably aerodynamic for a wagon. Initially available with a rear-mounted electric motor producing 286 horsepower (210 kW) and 402 lb-ft of torque driving the rear wheels, with dual-motor all-wheel drive variants expected to join the lineup later. The launch model features a 77 kWh (net) battery providing a WLTP-rated range of up to 373 miles for the Pro variant, with the larger 86 kWh battery in the Pro S extending this to approximately 425 miles—among the longest ranges available in the electric vehicle market. DC fast charging capabilities of up to 200 kW enable a 10-80% charge in approximately 30 minutes under ideal conditions. The interior maintains the ID.7 sedan's minimalist, technology-focused approach with a standard 15-inch touchscreen infotainment system, augmented reality head-up display, and illuminated touch sliders for climate and volume controls, while adding significant practical advantages through the expanded cargo area offering 605 liters of space with the rear seats up and 1,714 liters when folded—comparable to or exceeding conventional combustion-engine wagons in the same class. Advanced features include electrically adjustable ergoActive seats with massage and ventilation functions, a panoramic sunroof with smart glass that can be switched from transparent to opaque via electrical control, and the latest generation of Travel Assist for partially automated driving. The ID.7 Tourer fills an important niche in the electric vehicle market as one of very few electric station wagons, offering a practical alternative to electric SUVs for buyers seeking maximum cargo space with more car-like driving dynamics and efficiency, particularly appealing in European markets where wagons maintain significant popularity among premium and business customers."
